## Project Background
In the field of embodied intelligence, the open-source humanoid robot project Openloong has important research and application value. Currently, the project uses ROS as middleware, but ROS has **many issues**. Its architectural design faces challenges in large-scale, complex embodied intelligence systems, has limitations in data transmission performance, and encounters difficulties with AI capabilities. The Dora-rs robot middleware has **significant advantages** in AI framework support, execution speed, software quality, and security trustworthiness, which can meet the stringent requirements of robots for next-generation software platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to port the dora-rs robot framework to the Openloong project to address existing issues.

The goal of Dora Openloong is to improve the architectural design of the Openloong project, solve problems such as complex communication topology and weak AI capabilities of the ROS architecture in complex embodied intelligence systems, and improve system scalability. It aims to enhance data transmission performance, reduce communication latency, ensure system real-time performance when processing large amounts of real-time data, and meet the requirements of scenarios such as real-time obstacle avoidance and rapid response to interactive commands. It optimizes computing resource management to fully utilize hardware resources on resource-constrained embedded devices, improve system performance, and reduce the impact on robot endurance and operating efficiency. It provides a convenient AI pre-integration framework to **enhance support for robot AI capabilities**.

## Project Implementation
This project provides a series of development examples in the [ospp2025-openloong repository](https://github.com/dora-rs/ospp2025-openloong) and offers [related documentation](https://github.com/dora-rs-org/dora-rs-org), aiming to help users quickly get started with the Openloong-Dora framework. These examples include: Openloong robot navigation, Openloong upper limb control, Openloong chassis control, Openloong grasping examples, etc. The examples are implemented in Python;
