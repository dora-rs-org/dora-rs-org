# Welcome to Dora-rs

Dora is a lightweight framework for building **reactive dataflow applications**, designed for robotics, edge computing, and real-time systems.

## Why Dora?
- **Modular**: Compose complex pipelines with Operators
- **Low Latency**: Rust core + zero-copy communication
- **Multi-language**: Rust and Python nodes work seamlessly together
- **Lightweight Deployment**: No central scheduler, runs as a single binary

## Quick Start (Requires Rust)
```bash
cargo install dora-cli
dora new hello-dora && cd hello-dora
dora run
```
