# Hands-on Examples

Welcome to the DORA-RS hands-on tutorials! This guide will help you learn how to build robotic applications with DORA from scratch.

## Overview

DORA (Dataflow-Oriented Robotic Architecture) is a modern robotics framework that provides:

- **Modular Design** - Break complex systems into independent nodes
- **Low Latency Communication** - Shared memory and zero-copy transfers
- **Multi-language Support** - Python, Rust, C/C++ mixed programming
- **Lightweight Deployment** - No complex dependency configurations

## Learning Path

### Getting Started

If you're new to DORA, we recommend following this order:

1. **[Installation](./install.md)** - Install DORA CLI and dependencies
2. **[Windows 11 Installation](./install_win11.md)** - Detailed installation guide for Windows 11
3. **[Echo Example](./basic/echo.md)** - Understand basic dataflow concepts
4. **[Python Dataflow](./basic/python/dataflow.md)** - Create your first Python node
5. **[Using Camera](./medium/camera.md)** - Learn to process video streams

### Multi-language Development

Choose based on your preferred programming language:

- **Python Developers** - Start with [Python Basics](./basic/python.md)
- **Rust Developers** - Start with [Rust Dataflow](./basic/rust/dataflow.md)
- **C/C++ Developers** - Start with [C++ Dataflow](./basic/cpp.md)

### AI & Perception
